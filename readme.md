# Cpy
A tiny C compiler in python, only compiles a small subset of C and compiles into python code, this is meant to be more like a joke than a real compiler

```
$ python3 pyc.py hello-world.c > hello-world.py
```

You can then run your python program with(you might need to change your file to utf-8)
```
python hello-world.py
```
